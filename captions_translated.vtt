00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.639
Have you ever wondered how

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.319
does the audio in video games yes

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.319
you want to know the answer then

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.319
let's go straight to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.480
point video games occupy the third

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.320
position in relevance within the

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.320
Entertainment industry at the level

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.840
world at the same time is an unknown

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.039
For many engineers and enthusiasts

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.040
audio today we are going to learn how it works

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.960
the audio in the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.160
[Music]

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.840
video games the first thing we should know

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.200
is that audio for video games is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.320
approaches from a perspective

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.440
completely different from any other

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.239
audio branch because while in the

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.200
Musical production For example and the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.840
post-production is carried out on

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.039
fixed materials i.e. film or

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.920
the song They will always be the same without

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.600
matter how many times they are played

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.719
therefore our decisions about the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.879
sound will also be on the other hand

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.879
live sound has another perspective

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.960
because each concert is different and the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.719
things happen in real time so

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.760
every decision about sound is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.479
momentary and often temporary

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.760
audio in video games is located

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.159
right in the middle of these two and that is

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.520
although we know the situation that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.479
We are providing sound, we do not know the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.159
decisions that the player will make thus

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.119
example I can't create a song that

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.600
have a specific duration for a

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.520
level because the player may

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.920
finish the level in one minute as well

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.479
It may take 20 minutes So we can

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.360
say that audio for video games

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.840
It is a process in which we must raise

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.840
a versatile and adaptable sound all

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
time

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.479
before starting to design the sound

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.880
For a video game we must divide the

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.799
I work in two different scenarios

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.799
cutss and the material in

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.960
game the cuts or cinematics are these

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.960
rendered PR scenes

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.360
play and on which the player

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.640
has no control, that is, they are

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.520
small videos such as those

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.439
are displayed between levels at

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.119
introduction or at the end of the game

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.039
processing these css is something similar to

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.039
work done in post-production

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.560
because this scene is going to be the same every time

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.399
the times they are played if not

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.959
Are you clear about what post-production is?

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.280
I invite you to watch the video I have at

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.400
respect on the channel then here I must

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.560
complete the effects, music and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.840
dialogues and finalize your mix Because

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.519
It will be so exactly that it is reproduced

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.519
This is a good time to tell you that

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.599
You subscribe to the Channel that you like

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.599
video And if you like it

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.319
share on the other hand there is the material

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.239
iname that has another perspective

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.879
completely different since we depend

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.680
of the decisions made by the player and

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.640
These will be different each time

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.440
so no audio at this stage is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.040
fixed and there is a possibility that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.760
play many times as well as not at all

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.640
If for example we have a defined audio

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.239
for when a character takes damage

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.400
by an enemy the player may

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.000
decide to play the level stealthily

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.640
and complete it without taking any damage

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.040
therefore that sound is not reproduced

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000
But on the other hand the player can

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.760
take the action in your hands and carry it

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.239
to face his enemies and

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.360
probably this sound is going to

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.360
play many

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.080
times the individual elements of each

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.920
video game are called assets and they

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.080
They cover all elements of the game

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.200
like the characters the platforms

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.040
backgrounds etc. and the sound too

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.040
Get in there and these sounds meet

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.480
varied functions within the game

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.640
Gameplay cues that are basically

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.400
indications that provide the player with

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.319
information about the game such as

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.040
proximity of an enemy when you have

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.000
something looks at her or when you finish the

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.840
development of a skill these

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.200
sounds can also provide you with

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.720
feedback so you know if something

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.720
good or something bad happens to you

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.000
character on the other hand also exist

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640
sounds whose function is to manipulate the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.760
emotions of the player in order to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.319
make the game more immersive imagine that

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.360
you are in the middle of a battle and you

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.640
energy is reaching the minimum at that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.799
moment the sound will have more tension AND

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.599
probably more rhythmic elements than

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.280
They seek to create the sensation of anguish and

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.400
a little despair in the player

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.000
to recover in the same way if we have

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.000
Defeated all enemies the sound

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.480
can reveal and increase the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.480
feeling of satisfaction with the

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.120
victory just like in the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.000
post-production the sound in the

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:23.710
video games are divided into three large

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.960
categories effects music and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.400
[Music]

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.800
dialogues the effects are probably

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.440
the largest category of sounds and the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.520
main task that must be done there

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.320
perform is the sound design that does not

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.680
It is more than the creation of sounds without

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.800
precedents, that is, sounds that do not

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.160
They exist in real life and they should be

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.199
created for specific events

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.440
events in a video game are like

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.160
triggers or detonators of certain

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.759
things that happen within the game and this

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.199
It also includes sounds, for example

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.360
when a player presses the button

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.440
trigger the trigger event triggers

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.160
certain actions within the game such as

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.360
Play the gunshot sound but

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.360
also show the animation of it and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.479
basically each change goes within a

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.720
video game is started and ended with

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.720
a

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.199
event returning to sound design

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.440
the work makes use of the use of

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.680
synthesizers and effects to achieve by

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.680
example the effect of a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.360
[Music]

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.440
laser another type of effect with which

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.520
we must deal with these environments

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.600
They are usually loops and contain elements

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.600
that are not synchronized with the image

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.199
and that are usually part of the scene

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.160
With them I can give feedback to

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.800
player about the environment around him

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.639
just like you guys hear this

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.360
environment at this moment and that can

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.120
change at any time to give a

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.120
completely different context than

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.160
video there are also sounds that do not

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.840
come from sound design

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.280
which can come from bookstores

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.800
previously developed sound or

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.120
can be recorded by the equipment

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.919
video game sound here The important thing

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.639
is that they are of great quality and that

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.680
correspond correctly with the

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.240
experience that the player will have in

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.680
this example we can see our

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.720
character who runs but we do not know the

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.680
material on which it does so

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.280
you will be able to get an idea of ​​what their

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.919
environment nothing more When listening to their

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.880
steps and it becomes clearer Even if

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.880
we listen to everything

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.240
environment now let's talk a little about the

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.319
music that is largely responsible

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.479
to connect the player's emotions

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.360
so for example when seeing our

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.800
character with certain music we

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.080
can give the perception that it is

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.639
in front of something

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.880
dangerous or perhaps facing a

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:45.199
adventure

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.199
epic or perhaps on a much more journey

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.280
emotional but at the same time we have to

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:52.639
be consistent with the general concept

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.479
of the game So for example a theme

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.160
musical can be presented in versions

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.039
different ones that adapt better or worse to the

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.040
concept of the game, such as this one

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:06.790
case

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.790
[Music]

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.199
and for you, which one is the most consistent with

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.199
this character Leave me your opinion in the

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.199
comments probably on music

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.039
is the biggest difference with respect to

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.639
the tasks that are done in the audio Y is

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.199
than composing music for video games

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.680
requires quite a lot of skills

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:31.479
special and specific music in

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.879
video games should be viewed from two

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:36.360
points of view first it is about the

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:38.599
duration And the fact is that each piece of music is

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.400
developed for a specific level

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:42.960
and it must be as long or as short

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.360
such as the player's ability to

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.919
end that particular event That

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.759
It means that music must be able

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.720
repeat as many times as possible

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:52.639
necessary without the player noticing that

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.520
It's started again and this is achieved

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.199
regularly with the use of loops

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.199
fragments of music repeat

00:07:56.199 --> 00:08:00.319
constantly and are adjusted accordingly

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.560
careful so that happiness is not perceived

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:04.639
repetition in this way music can

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.280
have an infinite duration and

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.360
end the event in question

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.199
will reproduce a Splice with another piece

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.199
musical or with the completion of the

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:20.000
[Music]

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.120
The other point of view is the

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.840
layers that make up said piece of music

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.840
And these tend to behave

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.240
dynamic way Regarding events

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.240
what happens in the

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.240
game

00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:39.039
that is, music is not the same When

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:40.680
an attack has just begun that when the

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.200
player is about to exhaust all his

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:45.040
energy and the end of the event It is not the

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.680
whether the player wins or loses the

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.160
game this is solved by composing and

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.880
arranging music by layers of sound

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.519
that allow placing and removing

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.320
instrumentation and effects in

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:56.920
certain game events as well

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.040
our player can pass from entering

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.720
an enigmatic environment to have a phase

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.720
of action with many options in

00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:08.920
intermediate dialogues in a video game

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:11.480
require to be dynamic and generally

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.000
a huge amount of files must be recorded

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:17.519
lines a line can be from a

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.040
simple reaction like an uh Ah to a

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:21.360
line of dialogue And it is that regularly

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.440
a line of dialogue is recorded with two or

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.440
three variations so that in this case

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.040
is repeated does not sound

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.640
[Music]

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.880
monotonous It is also important to highlight

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.640
that the dialogues must be

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.079
especially clean since these are

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.160
they will end up reproducing in large

00:09:34.079 --> 00:09:38.040
variety of situations that change

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.600
depending once again on the

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.600
player's decisions And it is because

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.399
example the acoustics of the stage

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.440
will alter the reverberation with which

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:47.480
mix up the dialogue because it's not the same

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.800
that the character is in a cave

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.200
cave than in a bathroom a bathroom or in the air

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.720
free or in the open air now there is

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.320
some effects that need to be added to

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.640
the dialogues before being in the list

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.160
of assets So if a character of the

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.240
game has an effect that defines your voice

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.320
This does not depend on any event and

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.320
So much is processed before entering the

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:16.480
game a natural process in most

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:18.000
of video games is dubbing others

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.720
languages ​​And this is another stage of the

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.440
dialogues since they must be adapted here

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.200
each of those hundreds or thousands of

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.880
lines to a new language Here we have to

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.399
take into account the consistency in

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:31.040
certain extent and the duration and intention

00:10:27.399 --> 00:10:31.040
with the original interpretation

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.480
Now all these sounds must be

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.279
programmed to work within

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.519
of the game and although it is not a task

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:41.079
specific to the sound engineer Yes it is

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:43.519
very likely you will have to learn

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:45.839
some programming Since in certain

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:48.000
So this will help you understand which

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:50.800
are the possibilities and limits of

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.920
game engine Okay one more thing for

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.279
define the game engine basically

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.959
is the software on which

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:59.480
developed you've probably heard of

00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:02.200
from Unity or unreal engine or Cry engine

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.839
These are motors

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.639
game So not because you have an idea

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:08.360
means that it can be implemented

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:10.440
because the game engine has some

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.079
limits So if for example I want

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.920
make a sound have a certain level

00:11:12.079 --> 00:11:16.079
of attenuation or that of the sensation of

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.160
distance and let the motor take care of

00:11:16.079 --> 00:11:20.600
to do that first I must know if it is

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.360
possible and under what parameters the engine

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.279
He does it for this reason I must delve in

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.279
also a little in the

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.880
programming And if the work already seems

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.720
titanic you must also concentrate your

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.920
energy in doing something unique and

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.560
conceptually interesting since

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.720
same time being a job that

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.760
It requires a lot of technical skill too.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.720
It is on an artistic and creative level very

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.600
plaintiff because it is not just about

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:46.320
place the sounds but to give a

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.399
auditory identity that is consistent with

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.000
the interesting visual part for him

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:52.790
player and who is the main participant in

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.639
the immersive experience of

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:57.040
[Music]

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:58.399
I play something that maybe you don't imagine.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.000
that for many of those involved in

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:01.800
the development of a video game

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.959
experience is very far from sitting at

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.720
play for hours in fact at most

00:12:03.959 --> 00:12:07.959
Sometimes you find yourself developing

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.399
content for a video game OR character

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:12.399
or situation that you have not seen and how about

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:14.600
time you won't see Until the game is on

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.519
Test phase or directly after the

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.079
launch I have particularly had

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:21.440
the opportunity to work in large

00:12:18.079 --> 00:12:24.279
video games like cyberpunk 2077 it takes

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.880
two or Need For Speed ​​among others and the

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:29.720
I really haven't played any of them.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.399
they

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.480
audio for video games is a very topic

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:35.160
extensive and we will try to address each one

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.279
of its details in future videos in the

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.000
Channel for now This was all for today

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:42.040
about gaming audio

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:57.839
that you liked and let's go straight to the
